# **OYO Clone - MERN Stack Hotel Booking Application**

## **Overview**
This is an OYO clone, a MERN stack-based hotel booking application inspired by OYO Rooms, an Indian multinational hospitality chain. The application allows users to search and book rooms, apply filters for specific preferences, and make secure payments through the Stripe payment gateway. It also includes an admin panel to manage hotel listings and bookings. The project is built using the following technologies: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and integrates various libraries like AntD and Axios for efficient development.

**Tech Stack**
Front-end: React.js, Bootstrap, AntD, Axios
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
